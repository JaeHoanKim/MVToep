## Intended use 

Multivariate normal (Gaussian) sampling from the Toeplitz-structured covariance matrix is in diverse fields: from obtaining the approximate solution of the stochastic partial differential equation (see [1]) to directly testing the performance in the simulation studies (see [2]). Therefore, this package intends to efficiently draw samples from the Toeplitz-structured covariance matrix, with several user-friendly functions. For handy usage, it provides simple implementations for sampling from the regular grid points with radial basis function (RBF) and Matern kernels, with the covariance matrix of the autoregressive model. The main idea for this algorithm is suggested on [3].

## Installation

You can install the development version of MVToep package by: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JaeHoanKim/MVToep")
```

Then, use 

```
library(MVToep)
``` 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MVToep)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here:
