\title{Multivariate normal sampling from Matern covarinace kernel with regular grids}
\usage{
rmvMat(n, gridpoints, rho, nu, mu = rep(0, length(gridpoints)), tau = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of samples extracted from the distribution}

\item{gridpoints}{the gridpoints at which multivariate normal vector is drawn. Too ensure the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix, the grid should be regular.}

\item{rho}{length scale (non-negative)}

\item{nu}{smoothness parameter (non-negative)}

\item{mu}{the mean vector of the distribtuion}

\item{tau}{value of covariance matrix}
}
\value{
It returns the n by N (the number of rows in Sigma) matrix, in which n multivariate normal vectors are stacked vertically.
